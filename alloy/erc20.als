// ERC20: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol

// In solidity allowance is defined as mapping type:
// mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) allowance

// Note that "Mappings can be seen as hash tables which are virtually initialized 
// such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is 
// all zeros: a typeâ€™s default value. The similarity ends here, though: The key data is not 
// actually stored in a mapping, only its keccak256 hash used to look up the value."
